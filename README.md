# Daily Report Generator

This is a project that simulates the process of generating daily reports. The goal of the project is to **simulate regular contributions** to GitHub by automatically generating and committing updates every 6 hours.

## How It Works:
1. Every 6 hours, a new report is generated with the current timestamp.
2. The changes are committed and pushed to GitHub automatically via GitHub Actions.
3. This simulates ongoing development or contributions in a project.

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
